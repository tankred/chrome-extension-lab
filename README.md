# Chrome extension lab

Create your own chrome extension in minutes

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Using Our Extension
Loading our extension into chrome couldn't be easier. Go to the extensions menu with the url:

```
chrome://extensions/
```

Make sure developer mode is enabled (can be done in the top right corner), and then press "Load unpacked".
